    <p>Iâ€™ve been working with Farhan for the past 6 months, and honestly â€” itâ€™s been a roller coaster (in the best way). Heâ€™s incredibly fast, and Iâ€™m constantly trying to keep up. ðŸ˜… Picture this: Iâ€™ve been stuck on a problem for 2 hours, and he casually drops a solution while grabbing coffee â€” <strong>just a hint, and boom, Iâ€™m back on track ðŸ˜‚</strong>.</p>
    <p>Heâ€™s not just a talented developer â€” <strong>heâ€™s an amazing team lead</strong>. Supportive, sharp, and always pushing everyone to do better. <strong>Couldn't ask for a better person to work with.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Farhan grasped our vision and brought it to life brilliantly â€” going well beyond just meeting standards.</strong></p>
    <p>Iâ€™ve had the chance to see Farhan's work up close, and I can confidently say he's one of those rare developers who truly bridge the gap between design and engineering. <strong>His ability to translate complex design ideas into clean, scalable, and responsive code is exceptional.</strong></p>
    <p>What stands out most about Farhan is his attention to detail and strong sense of design aesthetics â€” something that's often missing in frontend development. Whether it's crafting polished UIs, building thoughtful user experiences, or shipping production-ready components, he handles it all with precision.</p>
    <p><strong>Beyond his technical skills, he's curious, fast-paced, and collaborative.</strong> He doesnâ€™t just build what's asked â€” he thinks critically about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> it should be built. Farhan is the kind of engineer you want on your team if you're aiming for quality and velocity.</p>
